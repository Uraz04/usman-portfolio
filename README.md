# usman-portfolio
The current HTML webpage is a mini portfolio outlining 3 main sections, About me, My work and Contact information. This project also includes refactoring the code for titles, semantic html elements, css grid box as well as keeping the order logical and clear. 

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Challenges
The short project presented challenges relating to the css styling of various html elements that had to be grouped together in the same alignment. Also, creating the css grid box and styling the elements with column/ row in mind. 

## Things I learnt
How to add css grid boxes and scrolling into view styling of html elements as well as further enhancing my understanding around css styling of elements.
